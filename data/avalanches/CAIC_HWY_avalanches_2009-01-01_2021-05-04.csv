We had mitigation planned. A plow and pickup truck behind him were stuck between slides. Crown came from only the lower tier of the path (the usual culprit). The avalanche involved only the new snow.,Suspect previous surface faceting as the weak interface between the new snow and old. Prior to getting snow totals -  we had called for mitigation in this area - based on the rapid load and continued poor conditions.  We were at 14 on the W. Lime stake when Mark got his early reading around 6:50 am.  This info plus the ongoing heavy snow and wind conditions prompted Mark to call for earlier mitigation than was originally planned.  The continued heavy snow and strong winds beat us to the punch and the slide ran sometime just before 9 am -  trapping a plow with following truck between slides.,30,,,,,,1200,1300,ft,300,400,ft,12,14,in,,Open,3,1600,ft
